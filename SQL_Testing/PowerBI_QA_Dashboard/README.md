# QA Metrics Dashboard — Power BI

A Power BI report built on bug-tracker and test-execution data for a fictional
e-commerce project (the same domain as my OpenCart testing project).

The data is synthetic. It was generated with a script to imitate a raw Jira
export, including the mess a real export usually contains. The analysis, the
cleaning decisions and the report are my own work.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `QA_Dashboard.pbix` | The Power BI report |
| `bugs.csv` | 263 raw bug reports |
| `test_runs.csv` | 794 raw test-case executions |
| `dashboard.png` | Screenshot of the report page |

## Data model

bugs.csv — one row per bug report: `bug_id`, `summary`, `module`, `severity`,
`priority`, `status`, `reported_date`, `closed_date`, `reporter`, `assignee`,
`environment`, `found_in_build`.

test_runs.csv — one row per test-case execution: `run_id`, `test_case_id`,
`module`, `build`, `run_date`, `result`, `executed_by`, `duration_min`.

Eight modules: User Account, Payments, Cart, Shipping, Admin Panel, Checkout,
Search, Product Page. Eighteen builds, 1.4.0 through 1.9.2. Reporting period:
March–September 2026.

## Data cleaning in Power Query

This is the part that mattered most. The dashboard took an evening; working out
what to do with the dirty values took longer and is the reason the numbers can be
trusted.

| Problem found | What I did | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Three date formats in one column: `2026-04-09`, `15/05/2026`, `05.05.2026` | Custom column with a conditional M expression that detects the separator and rebuilds the value with `#date(...)` | Power BI's automatic type detection silently failed on the mixed column and left it as text. Parsing by separator is explicit and reproducible. |
| Build numbers converted to dates: `1.4.0` became `01.04.2000` | Set `found_in_build` and `build` to **Text** in the applied type step, replacing the existing step rather than adding a new one | This is a silent corruption — no error is raised and 18 builds collapse into nonsense. It has to be caught by looking at the data, not at the error count. |
| Inconsistent capitalisation: `Checkout`, `CHECKOUT`, `checkout` | Transform → Format → Capitalize Each Word | Without it, one module is counted as three and every per-module figure is wrong. |
| Leading and trailing spaces | Trim (not Clean — Clean removes non-printable characters, which was not the problem here) | Same reason: ` Payments` and `Payments` group separately. |
| Two fully identical rows | Remove Duplicates **across all columns** | Important detail: running Remove Duplicates with a single column selected collapsed the table from 260 rows to 19, because many bugs legitimately share a `summary`. The step has to be applied with no column selected. |
| Placeholder row `BUG-1261` with empty fields | Removed | It carries no information and distorts counts. |
| 102 empty `closed_date` values | **Kept** | An empty `closed_date` does not mean missing data — it means the bug is still open. Deleting these rows would delete exactly the bugs the dashboard exists to surface, and would make the average time-to-close look better than it is. |
| 32 empty `assignee` values | **Kept** | Unassigned bugs are a real finding, not a defect in the export. |
| No time-to-close measure | Added `days_to_close` = `Duration.Days([closed_date] - [reported_date])`, null when the bug is open | Computed at the source so every visual uses the same definition. |
| Months needed for the trend chart | Added a calculated column `FORMAT([reported_date], "YYYY-MM")` | Using the built-in date hierarchy gave drill-down behaviour rather than a flat month axis; `MMMM` would have sorted alphabetically (April, August, December…). `YYYY-MM` sorts chronologically on its own. |

Verification after cleaning: 260 rows, 8 distinct modules, 5 distinct
severities, 6 distinct statuses, 0 errors in the date columns, 158 bugs with a
closed date and 102 without.

## The report page

KPI cards: total bugs (260), open bugs (102 — Open, In Progress, Reopened),
Blocker + Critical (29), average time to close (23.5 days).

Bugs by module and severity — stacked column chart. The palette is ordered
dark red → red → orange → yellow → grey so that severity reads as a gradient
rather than as eight unrelated colours.

Status distribution — donut chart. Green shades for resolved states, blue for
in-flight, red for Reopened, grey for Rejected.

Bugs reported per month— column chart on a single neutral colour. Red is
reserved for severity elsewhere on the page, so reusing it here would make the
page say two different things with the same colour.

Oldest open bugs — table filtered to Open / In Progress / Reopened, sorted by
report date ascending.

Slicers: module, severity, build, reporting period.

## What the dashboard shows

- User Account carries the most bugs (41) and the most critical ones (7).
  Payments is second overall (39) but has fewer Blocker/Critical issues (4). If
  test effort were allocated by headline bug count alone, User Account would still
  be the right place to spend it — which is not always the case and is worth
  checking rather than assuming.
- Reporting peaked in May and July (50 bugs each) and has fallen since
  (30 in August, 26 in September). On its own this is ambiguous: it can mean the
  product is stabilising, or that testing slowed down. Pass Rate per build —
  second page, in progress — is what separates the two.
- 102 of 260 bugs are still open, and the oldest has been open since 2 March
  2026. Several Critical and Blocker issues sit in that list. A backlog of
  reopened and critical bugs older than six months is a process finding, not a
  testing finding.
- Reopened is the third-largest status (35). A bug that is closed and comes
  back points at either incomplete fixes or verification that is too shallow.

## Still to do

Second page, after the modelling and DAX work: a date table, a module lookup
table with a one-to-many relationship to both fact tables, and measures for Pass
Rate, Failed Runs, Bugs per Build and Avg Days to Close, shown as quality per
build.

## Tools

Power BI Desktop, Power Query (M), DAX.
